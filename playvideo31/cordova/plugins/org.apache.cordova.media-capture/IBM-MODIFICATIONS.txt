RTC: 31827 - PMR 81991,211,788 : video capture on 4.3 Nexus

Video Capture fails with Android 4.3 on Nexus devices

- RTC work item number: 31827
- Apache Cordova Jira issue: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CB-5202
- Markmail or Google Group reference: none
- Product PMR: PMR 81991,211,788
- Description: Capturing video with a Nexus device running Android 4.3 was failing
because Android was not returning the correct file location for the newly recorded video.
The fix involved grabbing the newly created video's file location if it did not exist
in the intent. The bug seems to be isolated to Nexus devices on Android 4.3. On this stream,
we needed to cherry-pick 237d55 and 7184ef from cordova-plugin-media-capture.
