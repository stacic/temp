- Description: Backport CB-5398 to this branch. Without it, starting in Android
4.4.x, selecting an image with the Camera plugin API would only work when
the image was chosen from "Downloads" folder, or when the user chose an image by
going through the Gallery app, or when the image was returned as a DATA_URL.
This issue is caused by a content:// URI encoding problem with Android. The workaround
chosen forces the image picker to always go through the Gallery app instead of the 
StorageAccessFramework, which was introduced in 4.4.
